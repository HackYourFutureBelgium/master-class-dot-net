# .NET Master Class

Welcome to the HackYourFuture .NET Master Class ‚Äî a 10-week intensive journey into full-stack development with C# and the .NET ecosystem. This module is designed for students who already have a foundation in programming (especially JavaScript and React) and want to take their skills to the next level by mastering a strongly typed, object-oriented language, server-side architecture, and modern frontend/backend integration techniques.

Over the course of this master class, you will:
- Learn the core features of the C# programming language.
- Build a game step-by-step, starting from a console application and evolving into a full-stack web app.
- Explore the .NET ecosystem, including MVC, Web API, Entity Framework Core, Blazor, and SignalR.
- Apply software engineering practices like clean architecture, error handling, input validation, and separation of concerns.
- Develop a working multiplayer game with real-time communication and persistent storage.

By the end of the module, you'll be equipped with the skills needed to:
- Build and structure modern C# applications.
- Understand and apply object-oriented design principles.
- Create web APIs and connect them to rich frontend clients.
- Use relational databases with SQL Server and Entity Framework Core.
- Handle real-time communication using SignalR and Blazor.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this course, students should:

- ‚úÖ Be comfortable with basic programming concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, functions).
- ‚úÖ Have experience writing JavaScript (React knowledge is a plus).
- ‚úÖ Understand how HTTP works and what a REST API is at a high level.
- ‚úÖ Be familiar with version control using Git and GitHub.
- ‚úÖ Have a working development environment (VS Code, Node, browser dev tools).

No previous experience with C# or .NET is required ‚Äî we will cover it from the ground up.

## Preparation

Before the first session, please:

1. üõ† Install the necessary tools (see below).
2. ‚úèÔ∏è Make sure you can open and run a basic console app in Rider.

We‚Äôll help during the first session if you run into any issues, but the smoother your setup, the more time we can spend learning!

## Environment setup
IDE: *Rider*, *Rider* is a cross-platform .NET IDE that is used by many .NET developers. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download it from the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), it is free for non-commercial use.

RDBMS: *Microsoft SQL Server*, *SQL Server* is one of the most used relational database management system in the realm of .NET development. If you are a *Windows* user, you can download the **Developer edition** of *SQL Server* from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (or using this [direct link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2215158&clcid=0x809&culture=en-gb&country=gb)). If you are a Mac or Linux user, you can use the Docker image of *SQL Server*. You can find the instructions on how to run the Docker image of *SQL Server* on the [Microsoft website](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server).
