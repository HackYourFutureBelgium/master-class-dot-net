# ðŸ§° Preparation â€“ Lesson 3: Collections, LINQ & Structuring Code

## âœ… Goals for this lesson

This week, youâ€™ll:

- Work with `List<T>` and other collections in C#
- Use LINQ to filter, transform and sort data
- Understand the benefit of code reuse through class libraries
- Implement the singleton pattern in two ways
- Use logging and error handling with `try-catch`

---

## ðŸ§  Before You Arrive

Review (if needed):

- Arrays and loops from Lesson 1
- Classes, objects, and properties from Lesson 2
- Basic understanding of methods and return values

---

## ðŸ’¬ Think About

- Why is it useful to extract reusable code into separate libraries?
- What are the advantages of using LINQ over regular loops?
- When would you want a class to only have one instance?

See you in class!
