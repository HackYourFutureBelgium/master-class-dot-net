# ðŸ§° Preparation â€“ Lesson 8: Multiplayer with SignalR

## âœ… Goals for this lesson

This week, youâ€™ll:

- Understand what SignalR is and when to use it
- Set up a SignalR Hub on the server (API)
- Connect your Blazor app to the SignalR hub
- Send and receive real-time messages between clients
- Coordinate multiplayer turns using client-server communication

---

## ðŸ§  Before You Arrive

Make sure youâ€™ve reviewed:

- Basics of Blazor components (from Lesson 7)
- What a WebSocket is (basic idea of server push communication)
- The concept of client-server roles in multiplayer apps

---

## ðŸ›  Setup Checklist

Youâ€™ll need the following NuGet packages installed before class:

âœ… In **TicTacToe.Api**:
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
```

âœ… In **TicTacToe.Blazor**:
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.Json
```

Also make sure you can:

- Run both the API and Blazor apps simultaneously (TicTacToe.Api + TicTacToe.Blazor)
- Verify both are up in your browser (e.g. https://localhost:5001 and https://localhost:5002)

## ðŸ’¬ Think About

- How should turns be managed so two players canâ€™t play at the same time?
- What would happen if a player disconnects mid-game?

See you in class!
