# ðŸ§° Preparation â€“ Lesson 5: Creating a Web API & Consuming It

## âœ… Goals for this lesson

This week, youâ€™ll:

- Learn how Web APIs expose data via HTTP
- Create a simple API with ASP.NET Core
- Expose game logic through API endpoints
- Practice calling the API from front-end code

---

## ðŸ§  Before You Arrive

Review (if needed)

- REST principles: HTTP verbs (GET, POST), status codes
- Difference between MVC and API projects in .NET
- JSON structure and basic object serialization
- Basic JavaScript `fetch()` usage (if consuming API from frontend)

---

## ðŸ›  Setup Checklist

No new tools needed this week. Just ensure:

- You can run your existing solution in **Rider**
- You can create and run a `.NET Web API` project using the terminal or Rider
- You can send test requests using either Swagger (enabled by default), Postman, or curl

---

## ðŸ’¬ Think About

- Why is separating backend and frontend useful?
- What makes a well-designed API? (Think: routes, clarity, validation)
- How might you store and retrieve state in a stateless API?

See you in class!
