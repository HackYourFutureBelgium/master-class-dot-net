## 🎯 Objective

Apply object-oriented principles to expand your Tic Tac Toe game, introducing configurability, state tracking, and user interaction after game rounds.

## 📌 Tasks

### 1. Support dynamic board sizes

- Refactor the board so the game can be played on grids of any size (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5).
- Make sure the game still correctly detects a win condition and a draw for any size.

---

### 2. Track victories in the `Player` class

- Extend the `Player` class with a property to store the number of victories.
- At the end of each game, increment the winner’s score.
- After each round, display the updated win count for both players.

---

### 3. Add a post-game menu

- After a game ends, show a simple menu:
  - “Play again” should restart the game and keep scores.
  - “Exit” should quit the program cleanly.
- Validate the user’s menu input to avoid crashes.

---

## 🧩 Bonus Challenges

- Let players choose the board size at the start of the game.
- Display a leaderboard after multiple rounds.
- Add a sound effect or fun message when someone wins.

Good luck and have fun! 🎮
