# ðŸ§° Preparation â€“ Lesson 9: Improving Performance & Game Logic

## âœ… Goals for this lesson

This week, youâ€™ll:

- Use Riderâ€™s profiling and debugging tools to analyze performance  
- Optimize your LINQ queries and game logic  
- Clean up and organize your codebase  
- Add proper logging and error handling  
- Optionally explore caching for performance gains  

---

## ðŸ§  Before You Arrive

Make sure you understand:

- How your game logic currently works  
- Where potential performance bottlenecks may occur  
- How to use `ILogger` for tracing execution in .NET  
- Basics of LINQ and method chaining  

---

## ðŸ”§ No New Setup Required

Keep using the same projects (`Core`, `API`, `Blazor`), but prepare by:

- Running your game and looking for slow or unclear sections  
- Trying out Rider's debugger on your existing game flow  

---

## ðŸ’¬ Think About

- Where does your app do unnecessary work?  
- Are there magic strings, duplicate logic, or unclear responsibilities?  
- Do you log enough info to understand what happens in production?
